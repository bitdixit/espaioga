<h1>yWakeUp - Yoga Wake Up</h1>
Version: WUP "Agasana"<br>
<h2>Relaxing morning yoga timer</h2>
Yoga wake up is a specially designed application for those 
who want to practice yoga in the morning and don't want to
be late at work.<br>
<br>
Start the application and touch the screen to begin with the practice that
is initially set at 15 minutes. Each time you touch the screen you will add
5 minutes to your practice.<br>
After the time has been set, a bell will indicate that the practice starts.<br>
<br>
Later on, the bell will sound when 10, 5 and 1 minute are left to finish your practice.
This will help you planify your session.<br>
<br>
Keep the screen pressed to stop the timer.<br>
<br>
Some parameters can be changed via the Behaviour menu.<br>
